You will have to create 3 plots based on the datasets and instructions detailed below. You will find the plots themeselves in the `assignments/assignment_2_plots`. Your task is to write the code that will reproduce the plots as closely as possible.

# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), and working with factors (forcats)
-   Data visuzlization (ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
```

## Task 1: Climbing expeditions

The 2020-09-22 TidyTueday datasets are about climbing expeditions. From the three datasets, use the "expeditions". Reproduce the plot below! Notice a few things:

-   Use `forcats::fct_lump()` to get the 15 most frequent peaks, and drop the "Other" category.
-   The bars are ordered by the sum of all expeditions (use `fct_reorder()`).
-   The bar colors use the viridis palette and light theme.

```{r}

climbing <- tt_load("2020-09-22")


expeditions <- climbing$expeditions %>%

  mutate(peak_name = fct_lump(peak_name, n = 15)) %>%
  
  filter(peak_name != "Other") %>%

  mutate(peak_name = fct_reorder(peak_name, .x = peak_name, .fun = length))


ggplot(expeditions, aes(y = peak_name, fill = season)) +
  
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_light() +
  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1), legend.position = "bottom") +
  
  labs(title = "The 15 most popular peaks stacked by season of expedition", x = "Number of expeditions", y = NULL, fill = "Season")




```

## Task 2: PhDs awarded

The 2019-02-19 TidyTueday dataset is about phd-s awarded by year and field. There is only one dataset, it is called `phd_by_field`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all phd-s by broad fields.
-   To make the x axis breaks pretty, use `scales::pretty_breaks()`, to make the y axis labels comma formatted, use `scales::comma_format()`.
-   The line size is 1.2, the colors are from the brewer "Dark2" palette. The theme is set to minimal.

```{r}

phd_awarded <- tt_load("2019-02-19")


phd_awarded <- phd_awarded$phd_by_field %>%
  
  group_by(year, broad_field) %>%
  summarise(sum_phd = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(phd_awarded, aes(x = year, y = sum_phd, color = broad_field)) +
  
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  theme_minimal() +
  
  labs(title = "Number of awarded Ph. D.-s in the US by year", x = NULL, y = NULL, color = "Broad Field")

```

## Task 3: Commute in the US

The 2019-11-05 TidyTueday dataset is about commuting to work in each city in the US by bike or on foot. There is only one dataset, it is called `commute`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all commutes by state.
-   Both axis scales are log transformed and the labels comma formatted, using `scales::comma_format()`
-   The point size is 2, . The theme is set to light.

```{r}

# commute <- tt_load("2019-11-05")


# commute <- commute$commute %>%

commute <- read.csv('./commute.csv')
commute <- commute %>%
  
  filter(mode %in% c("Bike", "Walk")) %>%
  
  group_by(state_abb, state_region, mode) %>%
  
  summarise(sum_commute = sum(n)) %>%
  
  pivot_wider(names_from = mode, values_from = sum_commute)


ggplot(commute, aes(x = Walk, y = Bike, color = state_region, label = state_abb)) +
  
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(color="black") +
  theme_light() +
  
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  
  labs(title = "Title number of people walking vs. biking to work in each USA state",
       x = "Number of ppl walking to work (log N)",
       y = "Number of ppl biking to work (log N)",
       color = "State region")


```
