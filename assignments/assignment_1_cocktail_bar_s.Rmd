# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv",  header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>|<b4/>")   %>%

  
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>%
  
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "[[:digit:][:punct:]]|\\b(oz|abv|drop|drops|dash|dashes|bsp)\\b"))

head(cocktail_data)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

abc_ingredients <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  arrange(str_to_lower(ingredients))

print(abc_ingredients[8])

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

nr_ingredients <- n_distinct(cocktail_data$ingredients)

print(nr_ingredients)


```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

fr_ingredients <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  count(ingredients) %>%
  
  arrange(desc(n))

head(fr_ingredients, n = 13)


```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

most_ingredients <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  count(name) 

print(most_ingredients$name [most_ingredients$n == max(most_ingredients$n)])


```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}

min_ingredients <- fr_ingredients %>%
  filter(n == min(n))
         
print(sum(min_ingredients$n))

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}


rare_cocktails <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  filter(ingredients %in% min_ingredients$ingredients) %>%
  
  distinct(name)

print(rare_cocktails$name)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

nonrare_cocktails <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  filter(!name %in% rare_cocktails$name) %>%
  
   distinct(name)

print(nonrare_cocktails$name)

  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

cheatsheet <- cocktail_data %>%
  
  select(name, ingredients) %>%
  
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = ingredients, values_fn = list(ingredients = length)) %>%
  
  mutate(across(-name, ~ ifelse(. > 0, "X", 0)))

print(cheatsheet)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
